/* Twitch Chat Commands
/timeout <username> <time in seconds> -Times out the specified user for x number of seconds

/timeout <username> – times out the selected user for ten minutes

/timeout <username> 1 – purges the chat of the user. (Actually it times out the user for one second.)

/ban <username> – Bans the specified username

/mods – Calls up list of channel moderators

/slow – Turns slow mode on. I would prefer to be the only one using this command.

/slowoff – Turns slow mode off.

/clear – Clears the chat. We try to use this command sparingly and opt for the ‘purge' command.
